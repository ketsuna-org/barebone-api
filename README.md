# Bare bone example

This is a Bare bone example featuring Route handling with D++

Yes you can run a webserver using it !

and the size of the final binary is mind blowing :

```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 exa 26928 Apr 20 21:56 ./build/bot
```

If you want to run the example, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Also install the [D++](https://dpp.dev/) library. (ensure to get the master branch, and not the latest release, as it is not up to date with the latest D++ changes)


Then you can run the example with the following command:

```bash
./start.sh
```
